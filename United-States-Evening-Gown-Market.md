High-profile celebrity weddings and royal weddings also contribute to influencing popular wedding gown styles, which further drives consumer demand in the market. The wedding gown market continues to diversify, with bridal fashion increasingly incorporating modern and minimalist styles alongside traditional, voluminous gowns. Consumers are also becoming more conscious of environmental and ethical considerations, which has led to a rise in demand for sustainable bridal fashion. In response, a variety of designers now offer eco-friendly wedding gown options, catering to the growing interest in sustainable fashion. Additionally, virtual fittings and online wedding gown rental services have reshaped the market landscape, making it more accessible to consumers looking for flexibility, convenience, and affordability.
